        :Description: Estimation of the risk of future diagnoses of
        	      neuropsychiatric disorders (particularly autism) in early childhood,
        	      based on the diagnostic codes recorded during
        	      doctor visits. The prediction pipeline is based on
        	      inferring optimal stochastic generators for diagnostic code sequences,
        	      and detecting subtle deviations that drive up risk of
        	      an eventual neuropsychiatric diagnoses. The out-of-sample
        	      AUC score on the Truven dataset of insurance claims
        	      (close to 3 million children in out-of-sample data) is just over 80%,
        	      for both males and females.
        
        
        **Usage:**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            from ehrzero import ehrzero as ehr
            risks = ehr.predict_with_confidence(source_filepath,out_filepath,
                                                separator=',',delimitor=' ',
        					n_first_weeks=[week1,week2,..,weekn])
        					
        
        **Installation**
        
        .. code-block::
           
           pip3 install ehrzero --user --upgrade
        
        **EHR data format**
        
        Diagnostic data stored in text file, one line per patient as follows: patient id, gender and list of space-separated, comma-delineated diagnosis records, all separated by spaces. Each diagnosis record consists of the week since the start of observation, followed by comma and the ICD-9 code of the diagnosis. 
        
        Example of a diagnostic record for Lorax, male:
        
        .. code-block::
        
           Lorax,M 5,277.03 10,611.79 18,057.8 58,157.8 78,057.8 108,057.8 128,057.8 148,057.8
           <patient_id,gender> <code,week> <code,week> ...
        
           
        **Risk Estimation Example As Python Script**
        
        With properly formatted  patient diagnostic history, we use  function *predict_with_confidence* and specify the data filepath  and  the weeks of age at which  we want to estimate risk. Optionally, we  may also specify the separator (separating code and week, see example above) and delimitor (separating two code-week pairs, see example above)  for the diganostic records within file (space and comma are default).
        
        The predict_with_confidence function returns the predicted risk of autism for each patient for each requested week.
        
        .. code-block::
        
           from ehrzero import ehrzero as ehr
           source = './src.dat'
           outfile = './out.dat'
           weeks = [100,200]
            
           risks = ehr.predict_with_confidence(source,outfile,
                                               separator=',',delimitor=' ',
        				       n_first_weeks=weeks)
        					
        
        
        				       
        **Command Line Execution**
        
        
        A commandline tool *zero.py* is included in the package.
        
        It is located in the <installation_directory>/ehrzero/example. Typically, the default `installation_directory` should be `~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/`
        
        Invoking the tool with examples of diagnostic history
        included in the package may be done as follows (adjust for correct python version, and installation_directory):
        
        .. code-block::
        
           cd ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ehrzero/example
           python zero.py -data tests/exD1.dx  -n 145 148 150 160 165 170 180
