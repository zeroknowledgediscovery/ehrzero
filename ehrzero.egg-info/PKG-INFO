        :Description: Estimation of the risk of future diagnoses of
        	      neuropsychiatric disorders (particulalrly autism) in early childhood,
        	      based on the diagnostic codes recorded during
        	      doctor visits. The prediction pipeline is based on
        	      inferring optimal stochastic generators for diagnostic code sequences, and detecting subtle deviations that drive up risk of
        	      an eventual neuropsychiatric diagnoses. The out-of-sample
        	      AUC score on the Truven dataset of insurance claims (over 5M children) is just over 80%.
        
        
        **Usage:**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            from ehrzero import ehrzero
            ehr.predict_with_confidence(SOURCE,n_first_weeks)
